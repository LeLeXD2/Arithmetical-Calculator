# Arithmetical-Calculator
Developed an advanced calculator capable of evaluating complex arithmetic expressions. Implemented postfix notation for expression parsing and used binary trees to represent and compute hierarchical operations. Leveraged multiple data structures such as stacks and queues to manage operands and operators efficiently, ensuring correct order of operations and handling of parentheses. Designed for both accuracy and performance, the calculator demonstrates a strong understanding of algorithmic problem-solving and core data structure concepts.
